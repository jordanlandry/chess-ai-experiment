# Experimental Chess Project

This project is an experimental chess application aimed at exploring various methods of implementing a chess AI. The primary objective is to gain experience in writing code in Rust, as the chess engine is implemented in this language. Additionally, the project utilizes Cargo, a backend tool, to facilitate communication between the chess engine and the front-end, which was created in React with TypeScript.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to delve into the world of chess AI development and experiment with different approaches and techniques. By undertaking this project, I aim to broaden my understanding of chess algorithms, gain insights into optimization strategies, and enhance my programming skills in Rust.

## Development

During the development of this experimental chess project, I delved into the fascinating world of bit manipulation and discovered its potential for significantly improving the performance of a chess engine. By representing the chessboard and game state using bitboards, which are arrays of bits, I was able to leverage bitwise operations to efficiently store and manipulate board positions, piece locations, and legal moves. This approach drastically reduced the memory footprint and computational overhead of the engine, resulting in faster move generation and evaluation. The clever use of bitwise operations, such as bit shifting, bitwise AND/OR, and bit counting, allowed for lightning-fast calculations and optimizations. Implementing these techniques provided me with a deeper understanding of how bit manipulation and bitboards can revolutionize chess engine development by maximizing computational efficiency and unleashing the full potential of modern hardware.
